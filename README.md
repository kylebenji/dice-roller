dnd dice rolling project

current functionality is limited to a single size of die with no modifiers, goal is to expand this to include modifiers as well as the option for multiple types of dice

current system also has no way of hiding the detailed view once it is displayed, planning to add a "hide" button to allow the user to remove the details if they would like.
